<!-- 1. HERO SECTION -->
<section class="hero-enhanced">
    <h1>The Semantic Engineering Revolution</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">Software development is at a turning point. The future belongs not to those who write the most code, but to those who build the most intelligent **living models**. This is the shift from code as a liability to semantics as a continuously appreciating asset.</p>

<!-- 2. THE PROBLEM -->
<section class="paradigm-shift">
    <h2>The End of the Code-First Era</h2>
    <p>For decades, our industry has been trapped in a cycle: we translate human intent into code, which immediately begins to depreciate. This **code-first paradigm** is the source of our biggest challenges:</p>
    <div class="comparison-grid">
        <div class="trap-side">
            <h3>‚ùå The Code Liability Trap</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical Debt by Default:</strong> Every line of code is a future maintenance cost.</li>
                <li><strong>Lost in Translation:</strong> The "why" behind the code is lost, leaving only the "how."</li>
                <li><strong>Accidental Complexity:</strong> Systems become tangled webs of implementation details.</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Decay:</strong> Without a guiding model, entropy is inevitable.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="prevention-side">
            <h3>‚úÖ The Semantic Asset Solution</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Appreciating Knowledge:</strong> A semantic model grows more valuable over time.</li>
                <li><strong>Intent as the Source:</strong> The "why" is captured, versioned, and executed.</li>
                <li><strong>Inherent Simplicity:</strong> Logic is separated from implementation noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Architectural Resilience:</strong> The model enforces and preserves the architecture.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

<!-- 3. THE VISION -->
<section class="forcing-function">
    <h2>The Vision: AI-Native Enterprises Built on Living Models</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 1.2rem; margin-bottom: 2rem;">The next great leap in abstraction is to stop programming computers and start teaching them. A **Living Semantic Model** is a dynamic, executable representation of your organization's knowledge and logic. It is the enterprise's "second brain"‚Äîa single source of truth that powers everything.</p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 2rem;">
        <blockquote style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.1rem; margin: 1.5rem 0; background: rgba(255,255,255,0.1); padding: 1.5rem; border-radius: 8px;">
            "In the future, a tech company's core competitiveness will not be its codebase, but the quality of its semantic model."

<!-- 4. THE BRIDGE TO REALITY -->
<section class="prevention-demo">
    <h2>From Vision to Reality: The Semantic Projection</h2>
    <p>A vision is not enough. Past attempts like UML failed because they couldn't bridge the gap between the model and the running system. The model was a dead artifact, forever out of sync with the code.</p>
    <p>The **Semantic Projection** is the missing link‚Äîa continuous, automated process that translates the living model into concrete, running, and verifiable systems. It's how the abstract "what" becomes the tangible "how."</p>

<!-- 5. THE SOLUTION (ONDEMANDENV) -->
<section class="prevention-features">
    <div class="prevention-feature">
        <h3>ONDEMANDENV: The Semantic Projection Engine</h3>
        <p>ONDEMANDENV is the platform that makes semantic engineering a practical reality. It provides the end-to-end workflow to design, anchor, project, and evolve your semantic models.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prevention-feature">
        <h3>Anchor with `contractsLib`</h3>
        <p>Codify the behavioral guarantees between your system's components. The `contractsLib` is the **semantic anchor**‚Äîthe first concrete projection of your model's intent.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prevention-feature">
        <h3>Project into `Envers`</h3>
        <p>Translate architectural boundaries into isolated, versioned, **Application-Centric Infrastructure**. Each `Enver` is a perfect, self-contained Bounded Context.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="prevention-feature">
        <h3>Validate in `Constellations`</h3>
        <p>Assemble `Envers` into dynamic, end-to-end systems for fearless testing. The `Constellation` is the living, breathing manifestation of your entire architecture.</p>
