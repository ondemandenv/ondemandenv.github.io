# Article 6: The Method for Navigating Complex Systems — Semantic Abstraction, Simulation, Parallel Experiments, Selection

This final installment pulls the series together into a practical methodology for designing, evolving, and governing complex systems without succumbing to the x‑ops flat worldview. The core idea is simple, powerful, and broadly applicable: abstract the real world into domain semantics, exercise those abstractions through software simulation and reversible drills, run parallel experiments, and promote the winners. This is how to de‑risk the “first cut,” preserve reversibility, and keep complexity growing linearly.

The sequence matters: semantics → simulation → parallelism → selection. Each stage builds guardrails that prevent tools from becoming a centralized “brain” and keeps the Domain DAG as the unit of change.

## 1) Semantic abstraction first: make the “first cut” explicit

Goal: Turn implicit system intent into explicit, reviewable domain semantics.  
Output: Domain‑level models that any tool must obey.

Deliverables per domain:
- Bounded context map: what the domain owns, what it doesn’t; upstream/downstream contracts.
- Domain Dependency Graph (DAG): nodes (resources/actions), edges (order/constraints), attributes (timeouts, retries, compensations).
- Health gate specification: SLO probes, contract tests, synthetic checks, data consistency sentinels.
- Version policy: parallel deployability, routing rules, compatibility tests, telemetry fields, deprecation calendar.
- Event evolution rules: additive-first, tolerant reads, registry + CI compatibility, dual-stream migration plan.

Review criteria:
- Can this domain evolve and roll back independently?
- Are cross-domain interactions expressed as explicit contracts (prefer async) rather than hidden through gateways/mesh?
- Is every extra‑cluster dependency modeled as a first‑class node in the DAG?

Anti‑pattern to avoid:
- “We’ll decide in the pipeline/mesh.” That’s a tool-first cut. Pull the decision back into domain semantics.

***

## 2) Simulation and reversible drills: practice failure before it happens

Goal: Validate the model under controlled conditions; make rollback boring.

Plan‑time stack (transactional):
- Use CDK/CloudFormation/Terraform to execute DAG plans with explicit ordering.
- Wrap non-native steps in custom resources with idempotency + compensations.
- Drill reversals: forced timeouts, partial failures, out-of-order dependencies, and state reconciliation paths.

Convergence‑time stack (platform APIs):
- Define Crossplane XRD + Compositions + Composition Functions to expose domain CRDs.
- Exercise ordered GitOps sync (phases/waves), readiness checks, reverse-wave pruning.
- Validate backoff/retry budgets and timeouts; assert health gates catch latent failures early.

Chaos (only after design):
- Hypothesis-driven experiments to validate isolation and blast-radius limits.
- Exit criteria, stop conditions, and measurable learning artifacts.
- Never use chaos to “discover” missing boundaries; design should lead.

What “good” looks like:
- A catalog of rehearsed failure modes with playbooks.
- Measured rollback MTTR meeting domain SLOs.
- No reliance on “retry until green”; failures result in compensations or a clean abort.

### Example: Plan-Time Rehearsal with CloudFormation and Terraform

Plan-time simulation should use the plan artifacts themselves. Rehearse order and safety via CloudFormation change sets or Terraform plans (the plan is the DAG):

```yaml
# CloudFormation template (synthesized from CDK) — encode order with DependsOn
Resources:
  Storage:
    Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table
    Properties:
      TableName: example-storage
      BillingMode: PAYPERREQUEST
      AttributeDefinitions:
        - AttributeName: pk
          AttributeType: S
      KeySchema:
        - AttributeName: pk
          KeyType: HASH

  ApiLambda:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Function
    DependsOn: [Storage]
    Properties:
      FunctionName: example-api
      Runtime: nodejs20.x
      Handler: index.handler
      Role: !GetAtt LambdaRole.Arn
      Code:
        ZipFile: |
          exports.handler = async () => ({ statusCode: 200, body: 'ok' })

  LambdaRole:
    Type: AWS::IAM::Role
    Properties:
      AssumeRolePolicyDocument:
        Version: '2012-10-17'
        Statement:
          - Effect: Allow
            Principal: { Service: [ lambda.amazonaws.com ] }
            Action: sts:AssumeRole

  ApiGateway:
    Type: AWS::ApiGateway::RestApi
    Properties:
      Name: example-api

  LambdaPermission:
    Type: AWS::Lambda::Permission
    DependsOn: [ApiLambda, ApiGateway]
    Properties:
      Action: lambda:InvokeFunction
      FunctionName: !Ref ApiLambda
      Principal: apigateway.amazonaws.com
```

Rehearse safely:

```bash
# From CDK: synth then review plan operations via a change set
cdk synth > template.yaml
aws cloudformation create-change-set \
  --stack-name example-stack \
  --change-set-name dryrun \
  --change-set-type UPDATE \
  --template-body file://template.yaml
aws cloudformation describe-change-set \
  --stack-name example-stack \
  --change-set-name dryrun | cat

# Optional: use DeletionPolicy/UpdateReplacePolicy on stateful resources
# to constrain blast radius during rehearsals
```

Terraform plan-time rehearsal (the plan is the DAG, make dependencies explicit):

```hcl
resource "aws_dynamodb_table" "storage" {
  name         = "example-storage"
  billing_mode = "PAY_PER_REQUEST"
  hash_key     = "pk"
  attribute { name = "pk" type = "S" }
}

resource "aws_lambda_function" "api" {
  function_name = "example-api"
  role          = aws_iam_role.lambda.arn
  runtime       = "nodejs20.x"
  handler       = "index.handler"
  filename      = "dist/api.zip"
  depends_on    = [aws_dynamodb_table.storage]  # order in the plan
  lifecycle { create_before_destroy = true }
}

resource "aws_api_gateway_rest_api" "api_gw" { name = "example-api" }

resource "aws_lambda_permission" "allow_invoke" {
  statement_id  = "AllowAPIGatewayInvoke"
  action        = "lambda:InvokeFunction"
  function_name = aws_lambda_function.api.arn
  principal     = "apigateway.amazonaws.com"
  depends_on    = [aws_lambda_function.api, aws_api_gateway_rest_api.api_gw]
}
```

Rehearse and visualize:

```bash
terraform init && terraform plan -out=plan.bin
terraform show -json plan.bin > plan.json   # inspect ordered operations
terraform graph -type=plan | dot -Tpng > plan.png  # visualize DAG
```

Note: Plans encode order and basic safety. Compensations/rollbacks beyond what CFN/TF provide should be modeled in code (custom resources) and validated in rehearsal environments.

## 3) Parallel experiments: treat branches as product lines, not queues

Goal: Explore alternatives without locking the mainline or centralizing decisions.

Mechanics:
- For exploratory changes, spin up branches as independent product lines with their own builds, environments, budgets.
- Provision preview environments per branch automatically; seed with production-like data patterns and synthetic traffic.
- Use traffic control (A/B, canary, shadow) to gather head-to-head evidence.

Evaluation:
- Define decision metrics up front: SLO impact, error budget burn, cost per request, developer productivity (lead time, MTTR), contract breakage rate.
- Require compatibility CI and schema checks for each variant.
- Enforce time-boxing: variants either promote or decommission on schedule; no undead branches.

Promotion and retirement:
- Promotion is a contract-aware rollout, not a code-merge victory lap.
- Losers are decommissioned per a codified offboarding plan (data migration, topic drain, deprecations, budget release).

Mainline discipline:
- Trunk stays releasable: small steps, short-lived branches, feature flags, CI covers flag combinations.
- Flags have owners, expiry dates, and removal tasks; stale flags fail the build.

This builds on concepts from our MERGE HELL SCANDAL SERIES—see:
- <a href="/articles/pr-queue-scam-makes-merge-hell-worse">The PR Queue Scam</a>
- <a href="/articles/semantic-evolution-crisis-merge-hell-cultural">The Semantic Evolution Crisis</a>
- <a href="/articles/walking-on-many-feet-contract-branches">Walking on Many Feet: Contract Branches</a>

### Evolution Pathways in Practice (from "Walking on Many Feet")

The platform governs five evolutionary outcomes for branches:
- **Merge & Replace**: Winner becomes the new load-bearing enver; consumers continue seamlessly. Criteria: compatibility preserved, performance meets baseline, contracts validated.
- **Merge & Extend**: Additive enhancements coexist (e.g., REST + GraphQL), preserving existing producers; consumers opt-in gradually.
- **Co-Exist Long-Term**: Multiple envers serve different consumer needs; platform manages routing and observability.
- **Rejected/Archived**: Unfit branches are retired with recorded lessons (performance, schema, dependency issues).
- **Speciation**: Domain splits into new bounded contexts when semantics diverge (ownership, compliance, scaling).

## 4) Selection and governance: codify how winners win

Goal: Institutionalize how decisions are made so the organization scales linearly with domains, not exponentially with coordination.

Decision gates per change:
- Domain DAG present, validated, and linked in the change request.
- Health gates declared and rehearsed.
- Version and event evolution plans attached.
- Tool posture reviewed: mesh/gateway in composite/serving stance only; no cross-domain “brain.”
- Risk controls: rollback drills passed, compensations tested, error budget impact approved.

Automations:
- Policy-as-code for DAG linting (timeouts, retries, compensations required).
- CI enforcement of schema compatibility and version routing tests.
- GitOps orchestration enforcing phases/waves/readiness; block “retry-to-green” patterns.

Metrics and incentives:
- Track rollback MTTR, parallel version counts, cross-domain edge density, schema compatibility coverage, error budget consumption.
- Reward teams for reversible design, low blast radius, and successful deprecations—not for “heroic firefighting.”

## 8. Embedding into governance

- **Artifacts**: Each change request must include DAG diagram + health gate definitions + rollback plan + version/event plan.
- **Review gates**: Architecture review rejects changes that don’t pass the checklist.
- **Automation**: CI/CD pipelines enforce phase/wave order, health checks, and block merges if impacts cross domain boundaries without contracts.
- **Metrics**: Track rollback MTTR, parallel version counts, cross‑domain edge density, schema‑compat coverage.

### Example: Governance Enforcement in CI

To automate review gates, use GitHub Actions to lint DAGs, check schemas, and enforce flag expiry—blocking non-compliant PRs:

```yaml
# GitHub Actions: enforce stale flag cleanup and schema/contract checks
name: governance
on: [pull_request]
jobs:
  checks:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Contract lint
        run: npm run contracts:lint
      - name: Schema compatibility
        run: npm run schema:check
      - name: Feature-flag expiry
        run: node scripts/flag-expiry-check.js --maxAgeDays=30
```

This embeds governance into CI, ensuring version policies and DAG rules are checked automatically.

***

## 5) Tooling alignment: make tools serve the model (not the other way around)

Transactional domains (plan‑time):
- Prefer CDK/CFN/TF for “one change, one rollback” across heterogeneous resources.
- Pull extra‑cluster assets (datastores, queues, identity) into the same plan via custom resources.

Platform APIs (convergence‑time):
- Use Crossplane XRD + Compositions + Composition Functions to publish domain CRDs that encode policy and patterns.
- Accept eventual-convergence semantics; govern with ordered sync and health checks.

GitOps:
- Conductor of order and health—not your abstraction layer.
- Prohibit “environment = branch/dir”; parameterize environments and instantiate from templates or domain APIs.

Mesh/Gateway:
- Domain-internal resilience and ingress/BFF only; no cross-domain orchestration or data aggregation.
- Policies may reference domain-local SLOs and budgets; never act as a central business brain.

***

## 6) Putting it together: a day‑zero to day‑N playbook

Day 0–10: Modeling
- Produce domain maps, DAGs, health gates, version/event policies.
- Create CDK constructs or XRD/Composition APIs for core patterns.

Day 10–20: Simulation
- Build rehearsal pipelines; run rollback drills; inject failure modes.
- Wire GitOps phases/waves and readiness; verify reverse-wave pruning.

Day 20–40: Exploration
- Launch 2–3 branch variants for risky areas; provision preview envs automatically.
- Define traffic-based evaluation; collect telemetry and contract metrics.

Day 40+: Selection & Scale
- Promote the winner via contract-aware rollout; decommission losers per plan.
- Institutionalize learnings into patterns (CDK L2/L3, XRDs, Functions).
- Iterate quarterly: prune old versions, update deprecation calendars, refine health gates.

***

## 7) Why this works: linear complexity, bounded risk, continuous learning

- Linear complexity: Work aggregates by domain; cross-domain edges are contractual and sparse. The control plane does not become a central hotspot.
- Bounded risk: Every change has order, health gates, and compensations; rollbacks are rehearsed, not improvised.
- Continuous learning: Chaos validates isolation hypotheses; telemetry informs promotion and deprecation; patterns improve as code or platform APIs.

***

## One‑page checklist (printable)

- Domain modeled? Bounded context, DAG, health gates, version/event policy.
- Change DAG includes external resources? Idempotent steps + compensations?
- Rollback drilled? Timeouts/retries declared? Failure budgets set?
- Versions parallel, routable, measurable? Sunset calendar updated?
- Event schema governed? Additive first, registry + CI checks, dual‑stream plan?
- Exploration path chosen? Preview envs + traffic eval + time‑box?
- Tool posture validated? Mesh/gateway in-domain only; GitOps for order; no environment=branch.
- Metrics wired? MTTR, cross-domain edge density, schema coverage, error budgets?

***

This method is deliberately unimpressed by tools and relentlessly focused on semantics, rehearsal, and evidence. It turns “first‑cut anxiety” into a repeatable loop: model, simulate, explore, select. Applied consistently, it neutralizes the x‑ops flat worldview and gives teams a way to scale systems with reversible moves and domain‑bounded complexity.

  while (pending.size > 0) {
    const ready = Array.from(pending).filter((n) => edges.every((e) => e.to !== n || !pending.has(e.from)));
    if (ready.length === 0) throw new Error('Cyclic or unsatisfied dependencies');
    for (const n of ready) {
      await nodes[n]();
      pending.delete(n);
    }
  }
