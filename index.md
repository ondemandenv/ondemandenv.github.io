# OnDemandEnv: Revolutionizing Distributed Service Architecture

## Abstraction

In today's distributed systems, the challenge isn't technology - it's actually maintaining clear boundaries and enabling
rapid innovation. OnDemandEnv is the platform that revolutionizes service-oriented architecture by starting with
contracts first, creating focused spaces for both engineers and AI agents to work effectively.

OnDemandEnv is a powerful platform that transforms how teams build and manage distributed systems. The platform enables
developers to instantly create isolated environments with all infrastructure and dependencies.

What sets this apart is our contract-first approach: services define clear boundaries and interfaces upfront, which the
platform uses to manage environments and dependencies automatically.

## Key Capabilities

- Instant environment provisioning based on service contracts
- Automated dependency and configuration management
- Full isolation between environments for safe experimentation and testing

Because each service's context and boundaries are clearly defined, both engineers and AI agents can work more
effectively within bounded contexts.

## Platform Focus

- Minimize unnecessary complexity by providing observability of architecture, boundaries, and contracts
- Ultimate flexibility by describing boundaries and contracts with strongly typed code

## Challenges in Distributed Systems

Distributed systems like SOA/microservices are complex, presenting challenges such as:

- Maintaining consistency between service parts
- Managing configurations and versions
- Handling authentication and authorization
- Tracking changes and dependencies
- Balancing short-term gains with long-term strategy

## Philosophy and Goals

Our approach is based on Domain Driven Design, aiming to:

- Manage dependencies across multiple versioned services
- Generate repeatable and replaceable environments
- Define application architecture as code
- Abstract service contracts and relationships
- Enable comprehensive monitoring and deployment

## Architecture Overview

### High-Level Platform Structure

- **Contracts Lib**: Defines service contracts and relationships
- **Central Platform**: Interprets contracts and creates service contexts
- **Service Resources**: Deployed across multiple environments

## Deployment and Environment Management

- On-demand environment creation
- Branch and tag-based environment management
- Dependency visualization
- Dynamic deployment planning

## Example Implementation

We provide a concrete example using AWS, demonstrating:

- Serverless application setup
- Cross-account networking
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Service contract definition

## Real-World Example

A coffee shop application demonstrating:

- Order management service
- Order processing service
- Distributed system interactions

## Get Involved

We're seeking:

- Business partners
- Engineers to refine the platform
- Collaborators interested in distributed system innovation
