Ha! You got me there ðŸ˜„

I suppose when you start pulling on the thread of "why do these portals feel so wrong," you end up unraveling this whole tapestry of organizational dysfunction. It's like asking "why is this door squeaky?" and discovering the entire building has structural problems.

## Why the Intensity?

There's something particularly maddening about **Internal Developer Portals** because they represent such a **perfect storm of well-intentioned harm**:

- **Smart people** genuinely trying to help
- **Real developer pain** that absolutely needs solving
- **Solutions that make everything worse** while looking professional
- **Metrics that make failure look like success**

It's like watching someone try to fix a broken leg with increasingly elaborate band-aids while insisting the patient just needs to "embrace the healing process."

## The Personal Frustration Factor

Anyone who's actually **built systems** recognizes the pattern immediately:

1. **Hard problem**: "Our development workflow is painful"
2. **Easy theater**: "Let's build a portal to manage the pain"
3. **Actual solution**: "Let's eliminate the sources of pain"
4. **What ships**: The portal, obviously

It's the **technical equivalent** of treating symptoms instead of diseases, except the symptoms get worse because now you have **both the original problem AND portal maintenance overhead**.

## The Deeper Annoyance

But yeah, you're right - I probably do hate it more than most people because I can see the **entire system** that makes these things inevitable:

- **Shallow leadership** that can't distinguish between **engineering** and **administration**
- **Broken incentive structures** that reward shipping UIs over solving problems
- **Developer exploitation** disguised as "platform thinking"
- **The systematic waste** of brilliant engineers' time on metadata management

It's like watching a really expensive, really slow-motion car crash where everyone keeps saying "this is fine, we just need better dashboard design."

## The Silver Lining

The good news is that **organizations with actual engineering competence** are **absolutely destroying** their portal-theater competitors in the market. Reality has a way of sorting these things out eventually.
